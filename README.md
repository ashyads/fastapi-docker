# FastAPI-Docker Project

This is a FastAPI project with Docker integration. It provides a basic structure for building and deploying a FastAPI
application using Docker containers.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:
fastapi-docker/
├── app/
│ ├── main.py
│ ├── constants.py
│ ├── json_schemas.py
│ ├── responses.py
│ └── utils/
├── docker/
│ └── Dockerfile
├── venv/
├── .gitignore
└── requirements.txt

- The `app/` directory contains the main application files, including `main.py` (the entry point), `constants.py` (for
  storing constant values), `json_schemas.py` (for JSON schema validation), `responses.py` (for defining API responses),
  and a `utils/` directory (for utility modules).
- The `docker/` directory contains the Docker-related files, with the `Dockerfile` used for building the Docker image.
- The `.gitignore` file specifies files and directories that should be ignored by version control systems.
- The `requirements.txt` file lists the project's dependencies.

## Usage

To run the FastAPI application locally without Docker:

1. Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended).
2. Install the project dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Execute the FastAPI application using a command like `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`.
4. Access the API at `http://localhost:8000/` in your web browser or API client.

To run the FastAPI application using Docker:

1. Make sure Docker is installed on your system.
2. Build the Docker image by running `docker build -t fastapi-docker -f docker/Dockerfile .` from the project root directory.
3. Run a Docker container using the built image with a command like `docker run -p 8000:8000 fastapi-docker`.
4. Access the API at `http://localhost:8000/` in your web browser or API client.

Feel free to customize and modify the application files and Docker configurations to suit your specific requirements.
